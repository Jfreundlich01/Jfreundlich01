Youth Worker turned full stack developer. For the last decade, my job was to help young people through one of the hardest problems of life; growing up. Through my work as a curriculum writer, a designer of year long programming, and two years of independent learning and a three month software engineering bootcamp, I have found a love for using creativity to solve complex problems. I bring energy, joy and community building to any team.
